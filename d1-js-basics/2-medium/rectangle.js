/* 
We are going to build some functions to help us deal with rectangles.
All functions will take two numbers as arguments: argument1 is width, argument2 is height.
1. Write a function called findArea that returns the area.
2. Write a function called findPerimeter that will both return the perimeter and log it to the console.
3. Write a function that checks if the rectangle is a square.
Code Below*/

// Test command (in terminal) "npm run test:d1:medium:rectangle"
module.exports = { findArea, findPerimeter, isSquare };
