/*
We are going to build some function to help us with triangles.
The functions will all take three numbers as arguments s1, s2, s3.
Each number given is the length of a line.
1. isTriangle: will return false if the three lines are unable to form a triangle
                or it will return true if the three lines can be used to construct a triangle.
2. findPerimeter: will return the perimeter of the triangle using the three side-lengths.
=====================================================================================
Code Below*/

// Test command (in terminal) "npm run test:d1:medium:triangle"
module.exports = { isTriangle, findPerimeter };
