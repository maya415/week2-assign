/*  Create an object called cargo.
    This object has three properties: ship1, ship2 and ship3 with 
    values of 30,20 and 10 respectively.  Each ship is meant to carry equal weight.
    Create a method called shareTheLoad.
    This method will return a new object {ship1, ship2, ship3} with values representing 
    how much weight they are under or over to balance the three ships.
